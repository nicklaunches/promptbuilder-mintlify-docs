Prompt Assistant is a chat-first workspace for running and iterating on prompts you created in Prompt Builder.

Instead of opening ChatGPT separately, you can take a prompt from Generator/Optimizer/My Prompts and try it directly here with a fast assistant model (for example **GPT‑4.1 Nano**).

## What it’s for

- Run a generated/optimized prompt and see what it produces
- Iterate on wording, tone, constraints, and output format
- Save the best version back to **My Prompts**

## What it’s not for

Prompt Assistant isn’t intended for completely unrelated/general chat. If you want help, share the prompt you’re testing (or your goal) and the output format you want.

## Choose a model

Select the assistant model you want to run the prompt with. If you’re unsure, start with the default and switch models only when you want a different style or speed.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with a prompt">
    Paste a prompt, or insert one from **My Prompts**.

    Common sources:
    - Prompt Generator output
    - Prompt Optimizer output (via **Run**)
    - A saved prompt from Prompt Library
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick an assistant model">
    Choose which model should run the prompt (default model is configured in the app).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run + iterate">
    Send the prompt and evaluate the response. Iterate with follow-ups like:
    - “Keep the same structure, but make it shorter”
    - “Return output as JSON with keys …”
    - “Ask clarifying questions first”
    - “Add 3 examples and 3 edge cases”
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save to My Prompts">
    Use **Save** to store the exact version you want in **My Prompts** so you can reuse it later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generator vs Optimizer (when to use which)">
    - **Prompt Generator**: start from a rough idea and generate a first draft prompt, then refine it in chat.
    - **Prompt Optimizer**: start from an existing prompt and upgrade it into a clearer, better-structured version (with history).

    Use Assistant anytime you want to iterate on wording, tone, constraints, or format—regardless of where the prompt came from.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assistant model">
    The model selector controls which assistant runs your prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insert prompts from My Prompts">
    Use **My Prompts** in the composer to insert a saved prompt and continue iterating.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pin important work">
    Use **Pin** to keep key prompts and conversations easy to find.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="From Optimizer to Assistant">
    Using **Run** in Prompt Optimizer opens a new Assistant chat seeded with the optimized prompt.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for better chats

- Tell the assistant what success looks like (format, length, constraints).
- Include examples of “good” vs “bad” outputs if you have them.
- If you want the assistant to ask questions first, say so explicitly.
