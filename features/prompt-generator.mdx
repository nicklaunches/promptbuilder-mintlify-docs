Prompt Generator is a two-pane workspace:

- Left: describe your goal (“idea”) and choose a target model
- Right: iterate in chat, then save the version you want to your Library

## Core concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Target model vs chat model">
    - **Target model**: the model the prompt is optimized for (e.g. GPT, Claude, Gemini).
    - **Chat model**: the assistant you use to iterate on the prompt inside the chat.

    You can optimize for one model and iterate with another.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Chats">
    Each time you generate, Prompt Builder creates a new chat thread so you can revisit iterations later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Library">
    Use **Save** to store the exact version you want in **My Prompts**, so you can reuse it later (and run it in Assistant).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Generate a prompt

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the outcome">
    Write what you want to accomplish. Include:
    - Audience / role
    - Context / constraints
    - Desired output format

    <Tip>
      If you know the output format, state it explicitly: “Return JSON with keys …” or “Return a table with columns …”.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a target model">
    Pick the model you want the prompt optimized for.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Generate">
    Prompt Builder creates a new chat thread and posts the first prompt version into the chat.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Refine in chat

Use the chat on the right to iterate quickly. Good refinement prompts include:

- “Make it shorter and more direct”
- “Add step-by-step instructions and acceptance criteria”
- “Ask clarifying questions before answering”
- “Add 3 examples and 3 edge cases”
- “Rewrite for a different tone: friendly, formal, terse”

<Note>
  When you like a version, click **Save** to add it to your Library.
</Note>

## Reuse saved prompts

You can insert an existing prompt from **My Prompts** into the composer and keep iterating (no need to start from a fresh idea).
