Prompt Library is where you store, organize, and reuse prompts you’ve created across Prompt Builder.

It includes two tabs:

- **My Prompts**: your saved prompts (from Generator / Assistant / Optimizer / SMM Bot)
- **Community Prompts**: curated prompts shared by others (optional; can be copied into My Prompts)

## Find prompts fast

Use search and filters to narrow down results:

- Search by title, description, or prompt text
- Filter by categories (multi-select)
- Filter by target models (multi-select)

## My Prompts

My Prompts is your personal prompt workspace.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pin / unpin">
    Pin your best prompts so they stay at the top of the list.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit">
    Update the title and prompt content when you improve a template.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Delete">
    Remove prompts you no longer need (recommended: confirm before deleting).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run">
    Start a **new** Assistant chat seeded with the prompt.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Community Prompts

Browse prompts from the community and optionally **Add to Library** to copy them into My Prompts for customization.

<Tip>
  A great workflow is: add a community prompt → adapt it to your needs → save your edited version to My Prompts.
