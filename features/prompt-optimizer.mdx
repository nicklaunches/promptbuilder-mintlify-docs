Prompt Optimizer upgrades an existing prompt into a clearer, more structured version and saves a history of improvements.

## When to use it

Use Prompt Optimizer when you already have a prompt and want to:

- Improve clarity and structure
- Add constraints and acceptance criteria
- Make the output format explicit (JSON, table, checklist)
- Create a stronger “system prompt” style instruction set

## How it works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Input + model selection">
    - Paste your prompt, or choose one from **My Prompts** to auto-fill.
    - Select the **optimizer model** (the assistant that performs the rewrite).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="History">
    Each optimization is saved automatically to History with:
    - Original prompt
    - Optimized prompt
    - Timestamp

    Pinned items stay at the top.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run in Assistant">
    Use **Run** on a history card to open a **new** Assistant chat seeded with the optimized prompt.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Optimize a prompt

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with a solid base prompt">
    If your prompt is vague, add:
    - Who the model should act as (role)
    - The context and constraints
    - The expected output format
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose an optimizer model">
    Pick the model you want to use to perform the rewrite.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Optimize">
    Prompt Builder generates an improved version and saves it to History automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for best results

- Prefer concrete inputs: include examples, edge cases, and “don’t do” constraints.
- If you need a strict format, say so (and include a schema).
- Use short follow-up optimizations instead of one massive prompt rewrite.
